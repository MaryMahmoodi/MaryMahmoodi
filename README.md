- 👋 Hi, I’m @Mary. I am a biosignal processing algorithm design engineer and reviewer.
- 👀 I’m interested in signal processing and algorithm design for brain-computer-interface (BCI) applications.
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to collaborate on real-time signal processing and machine/deep learning in a closed-loop BCI system for rehabilitation purposes.
